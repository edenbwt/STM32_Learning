# KiCad & STM32 Projects

This repository is a collection of my personal projects for learning microelectronics and hardware coding, using KiCad for PCB design and STM32 for embedded systems programming.

## Project Overview

Each project folder contains:
- **KiCad files**: Schematics and PCB layouts.
- **STM32 Code**: Firmware for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Tools Used
- **KiCad**: PCB design tool.
- **STM32CubeIDE**: For developing and programming STM32 microcontrollers.

## Projects

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Project 1 | My first project using KiCad and STM32, the base is a STM32F405RGT6 powerded by a usb type-c cable |


This repository is for personal use, documenting my progress in learning.
